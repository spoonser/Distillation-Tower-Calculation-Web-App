# Distillation Tower Cost Minimization Web Application

Complete overhaul of a standalone series of python scripts written in 2019 for 
a chemical engineering course. This project aims to modularize that code, 
provide a web interface for the user, and make use of programming paradigms I 
was not familiar at the time.



Credit for assistance on the initial project goes to Griffin Drake and Daniel 
Goddard, my team members in CHE411 at OSU.
